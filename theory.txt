Component Based Development
------------------------------
Compoenent based development means designing our software applications by 
building loosely-coupled independent components

What is Compoenent ?
---------------
A component is a well-defined and independent piece of our app's user interface

A Compoenent could include, but not limited to

* Button
* Header 
* Footer
* Navigation
* Table
* Pagination

Why Do we need Compoenents ?
---------------------------
Compoenents build off of the concept of Aax Requests, 
in which calls to the server made directly from client-side,
allowing for the DOM to be dynamically updated without the 
need of `page refresh`

Because compoenets are independent, one component can refresh without
affecting other compoenents or th UI as a whole

Types components
-------------------
1. Functional Components
2. Class Components
