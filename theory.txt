Component Based Development
------------------------------
Compoenent based development means designing our software applications by 
building loosely-coupled independent components

What is Compoenent ?
---------------
A component is a well-defined and independent piece of our app's user interface

A Compoenent could include, but not limited to

* Button
* Header 
* Footer
* Navigation
* Table
* Pagination

Why Do we need Compoenents ?
---------------------------
Compoenents build off of the concept of Aax Requests, 
in which calls to the server made directly from client-side,
allowing for the DOM to be dynamically updated without the 
need of `page refresh`

Because compoenets are independent, one component can refresh without
affecting other compoenents or th UI as a whole

Types components
-------------------
1. Function Components
2. Class Components


React JS Basics
----------------
props - Shortcut for properties 

props - We can use props to allow compoenenst to talk to each other

-> Get passed co component function parameters
-> props are immutable
-> props - function component
-> this.props - class component

state - React updates UI based on the application state. 
      - This is actuallys stored as a property of react Class Compoement

-> State is managed with in the component
-> state can be changed
-> useSate() - Function Component
-> this.state - Class Component


JSX - Javscript XML 
-------------------
Extension for javascript Language Syntax

JSX is not manadtory to write react compoenents

JSX makes our code simplified and elegant

JSX ultimately transpiles to pur javascript which is understood by the browsers
